HEY!

If you would like to hide the theme's footer text just add this line:
#credit {display:none}
at the bottom of the style.css file to hide it without messing up the code.

And if you would like to add links to the bottom, just uncomment the
html code portions below (remove the <!-- and --> ) and follow that format
as a template
*/

<?php wp_footer(); ?>

<div id="page_footer">
	<!--
	<a href="#link">Link1</a>
	<a href="#link">Link2</a>
